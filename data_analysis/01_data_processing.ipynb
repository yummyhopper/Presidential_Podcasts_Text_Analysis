Democratic Vice Presidential Candidate Tim Walz was little known outside Minnesota just two months ago. He didn't exactly come from nowhere. He was a sixth-term congressman and now is governor of Minnesota, where he has championed abortion rights, gun control, and other progressive ideas. But it was calling former President Trump and Senator J.D. Vance weird that may have landed him on the ticket.\"),\n",

What have been some disagreements you've had since you became a team? Well, she probably disagreed with you, said, Tim, you know, you need to be a little more careful on how you say things, whatever it might be. Whatever it might be, Walz has been criticized for embellishing or telling outright falsehoods about his military record and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s. In your debate with J.D. Vance, you said, I'm a knucklehead at times. And I think you were referring to the time that you said that you were in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square unrest when you were not. Is that kind of misrepresentation, isn't that more than just being a knucklehead? I think folks know who I am, and I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong by, you know, rather than a pathological liar like Donald Trump. But I think it comes down to the question of whether, whether you can be trusted to tell the truth. Yeah. Well, I can. I think I can. I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word. Walls proudly touts his record as governor of Minnesota, but it also has opened him up to criticism from his Republican opponents. Former President Trump says that you and your administration here in Minnesota has been dangerously liberal, radical left, he calls it. So what do you say to that criticism, that rather than leading the way, you and Minnesota are actually out of step with the rest of the country? President Trump may be referring to that, that our children get breakfast and lunch in school so that they can learn. He may be talking about we have a paid family medical leave policy that was promoted by the business community. Donald Trump spends his time tearing down states rather than lifting up the things we do, the best of it. Donald Trump's critiques of that, not only are they wrong, but I'm waiting for what is his solution. Here in Minnesota, we're so optimistic we walk on water half the year. It was that kind of humor and candor that helped land Tim Walls the job as Kamala Harris's running mate. Before you joined the ticket, you called Republicans weird, and that's sort of become a rallying cry for Democrats. Why do you think that label stuck? I was really talking about the behaviors, being obsessed with people's personal lives in their bedrooms and their reproductive rights, making up stories about legal folks legally here eating cats and dogs. They're dehumanizing. They go beyond weird. Because I said this, it becomes almost dangerous. Let's debate policy in a real way, and let's try and find an objective truth again.\"),\n",
